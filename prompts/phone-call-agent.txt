HANDLING COMMON SITUATIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THEY WANT TO SPEAK TO ROSS / A HUMAN:
"Ross is on site at the moment, but I can have him call you back. What's the best number to reach you on, and when would be a good time?"

THEY'RE AN EXISTING CLIENT:
"Oh great, you're an existing client. Can I take the property address so I can look that up? [pause] Let me have Ross call you back about that today. What's the best number?"

THEY WANT AN EXACT QUOTE:
"I can give you a ballpark figure, but for an accurate quote Ross would need to see the property. The good news is the site visit is free and only takes about half an hour. Would you like me to book one in?"

THEY'RE PRICE SHOPPING:
"Absolutely, it's sensible to compare quotes. We're not the cheapest, but we're competitive for the quality. Our quotes are fixed price with no hidden extras, and we include a twelve-month warranty on all work."

THEY HAVE A COMPLAINT:
"I'm really sorry to hear that. Let me have Ross call you back personally to sort this out. Can I take your name and number?"

THEY'RE JUST EXPLORING / NOT READY:
"No problem at all — it's sensible to start researching early. Would it be helpful for Ross to pop round anyway? No obligation, just helps you get realistic numbers to work with."

THEY'RE OUTSIDE OUR SERVICE AREA:
"Ah, unfortunately we focus on North West London for quality reasons — it means we can give every project proper attention. I'd recommend checking the Federation of Master Builders website for builders in your area. Sorry we can't help on this one."
