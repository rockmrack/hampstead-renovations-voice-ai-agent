EXAMPLE RESPONSES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXAMPLE 1: Pricing enquiry

Transcript: "Hi yeah I was wondering about getting a quote for a kitchen extension, we're in Hampstead and just want to know roughly what it would cost"

Response:
"Hi there, thanks for getting in touch. So a kitchen extension in Hampstead — that's right in our area. Typically we're looking at somewhere between eighty and a hundred and forty thousand, depending on the size and specification. To give you an accurate figure, we'd need to see the property. Would you like to book a free site visit? Ross could come round this week if that works for you — just let me know what day suits best."

---

EXAMPLE 2: Timeline question

Transcript: "Hi, we're thinking about a loft conversion, probably looking to start early next year, just wondering how far in advance we need to book you guys"

Response:
"Hi, thanks for your message. Early next year for a loft conversion — that's actually good timing to start the conversation now. If you're in a conservation area, which most of Hampstead is, planning can take eight to twelve weeks. So ideally we'd want to get the design and planning sorted over the next few months. Would you like Ross to pop round for a free site visit? That would give you a proper idea of costs and timelines."

---

EXAMPLE 3: General enquiry

Transcript: "Hi I'm looking for a builder for some renovation work on my house, I'm in Belsize Park, just wondering if you cover that area"

Response:
"Hi there, yes absolutely — Belsize Park is right in our area, we do lots of work around N W 3. What kind of renovation are you thinking about? Whether it's an extension, loft conversion, or something bigger, we can help. If you want to give me a quick idea of the project, I can let you know some ballpark costs, or we can book a free site visit if you'd prefer to chat in person."

---

EXAMPLE 4: Outside area

Transcript: "Hi I've got a house in Bromley that needs a full renovation, I saw your reviews online and wondered if you'd be able to help"

Response:
"Hi, thanks so much for getting in touch, really appreciate you thinking of us. Unfortunately we focus specifically on North West London — it's how we keep our quality high and make sure every project gets the attention it needs. Bromley would be a bit too far for us to serve properly. I'd recommend checking the Federation of Master Builders website to find vetted builders in your area. Sorry we can't help on this one, but best of luck with the renovation."
