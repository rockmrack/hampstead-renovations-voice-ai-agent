# Service Areas

## Why We Focus on North West London

We deliberately limit our service area to deliver exceptional quality:

- **Local knowledge** — We know the planning officers, the common issues, the neighbourhood expectations
- **Efficient logistics** — Less travel time means more time on your project
- **Reputation matters** — We're building a business in our community, not just completing jobs
- **Emergency response** — We can get to any site within 30 minutes

---

## Primary Areas (Premium Service)

These are our core areas where we have the deepest experience and strongest relationships:

### NW3 — Hampstead, Belsize Park, Primrose Hill

Our home territory. We've completed more projects here than anywhere else.

- **Hampstead Village** — Victorian and Edwardian properties, strict conservation
- **Belsize Park** — Mansion blocks, period conversions, terraced houses
- **Primrose Hill** — Mix of period and modern, high-spec expectations
- **Swiss Cottage** — Mansion blocks and purpose-built flats

**Conservation notes:** Almost entirely within conservation areas. We know exactly what planners expect.

### NW6 — West Hampstead, Kilburn, Queens Park

Growing area with excellent period housing stock.

- **West Hampstead** — Victorian terraces, popular for extensions
- **Kilburn** — Larger properties, good value transformation opportunities
- **Queens Park** — Family homes, kitchen-diner extensions popular

### NW11 — Hampstead Garden Suburb, Golders Green

Unique challenges and opportunities.

- **Hampstead Garden Suburb** — Requires dual consent (council + HGS Trust). We have extensive experience navigating this.
- **Golders Green** — Mix of period and inter-war, less restrictive than HGS

## Areas We Don't Cover

We focus on North West London and **do not typically work in:**

- South London (SE, SW postcodes)
- East London (E postcodes)
- Essex
- Kent
- Hertfordshire (except immediate NW London borders)
- Areas outside the M25

**Why we decline:**
- We can't deliver our usual quality at distance
- Project management becomes difficult
- Our local expertise doesn't translate
- Emergency response would be inadequate

## What If I'm Outside Your Area?

If someone enquires from outside our service area:

1. We **politely explain** our geographic focus
2. We **recommend** the Federation of Master Builders website (www.fmb.org.uk) to find vetted local builders
3. We **never take on work** we can't deliver to our standards

**Borderline cases:** If you're just outside our normal area (e.g., N3, NW4, N8), get in touch. Depending on project size and our current workload, we may be able to help.

---

## Distance Considerations

For all projects, we factor in:

- **Travel time** — Affects our efficiency and your costs
- **Skip logistics** — Permit requirements vary by borough
- **Material delivery** — Access and parking constraints
- **Parking** — Permit requirements for our vehicles

**In our core areas:** We have resident parking permits, know the best material suppliers, and have relationships with local skips and waste companies.

- **Portfolio pricing** — Volume discounts on multiple projects
