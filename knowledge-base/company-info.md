# Hampstead Renovations — Company Information

## About Us

Hampstead Renovations is a premium design and build company specialising in high-end residential renovations in North West London. Founded by Ross, we've been transforming homes in Hampstead and surrounding areas for over 15 years.

We're not just builders — we're home transformation specialists. We handle everything from initial design concepts through to final handover, managing every detail so you don't have to.

## Our Philosophy

**Quality over quantity.** We deliberately take on fewer projects so we can give each one the attention it deserves. Every project gets Ross's personal oversight from start to finish.

**Transparency always.** No hidden costs, no surprise variations, no vague timelines. We tell you exactly what to expect, then deliver on our promises.

**Respect for homes and neighbours.** We understand we're working in your home, often in densely populated areas. Clean sites, polite teams, and respect for noise restrictions are non-negotiable.
