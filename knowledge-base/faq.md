# Frequently Asked Questions

## Planning & Permissions

### Do I need planning permission for an extension?

It depends on several factors:

**Permitted Development (Usually NO planning needed):**
- Rear extensions up to 3m (attached) or 4m (detached)
- Single-storey side extensions up to half the width of the original house
- Loft conversions adding up to 40-50 cubic metres

**Planning Permission REQUIRED:**
- Properties in conservation areas (most of Hampstead, Belsize Park, HGS)
- Listed buildings
- Extensions exceeding permitted development limits
- Mansard loft conversions
- Front extensions or significant changes to front elevation

**Our approach:** We assess your property and handle the entire planning process. We have an 95%+ approval rate in conservation areas.

### What about conservation areas?

We specialise in conservation area projects — it's a significant part of our work.

**Key areas we work in:**
- Hampstead Conservation Area
- Belsize Conservation Area
- Hampstead Garden Suburb (requires dual consent)
- Highgate Conservation Area
- Primrose Hill Conservation Area

**What we know:**
- Which materials planners accept
- Appropriate window styles and proportions
- Roof pitch and dormer design requirements
- How to present applications for best chance of approval

**Our track record:** 50+ successful conservation area projects. We know what planners look for and design accordingly.

### How long does planning permission take?

| Type | Typical Timeline |
|------|------------------|
| Householder Application | 8 weeks |
| Full Planning Application | 8-13 weeks |
| Pre-Application Advice | 4-6 weeks |
| Listed Building Consent | 8-13 weeks |
| HGS Trust Approval | 4-8 weeks (additional to council) |

**Our recommendation:** For complex projects, we often submit a pre-application first. It costs £100-200 but gives early feedback and significantly improves approval chances.

### What is Party Wall and do I need an agreement?

The Party Wall Act 1996 applies if your work:
- Affects a shared wall between properties
- Involves excavation near a neighbour's property
- Could affect the structural support of adjoining buildings

**What happens:**
1. We serve notice on affected neighbours (2 months before work)
2. Neighbours can consent (free) or appoint a surveyor
3. If surveyors involved, they agree a Party Wall Award
4. Award protects both parties and documents property condition

**Typical costs:** £800-1,500 per neighbour if surveyors are required

**We handle:** The entire party wall process, including surveyor coordination.

## Costs & Payments

### Are your prices fixed or estimates?

**Fixed price** for the defined scope.

Our quotes are comprehensive and detailed. Once you accept, that price is fixed — we don't come back asking for more money because we "forgot something" or "didn't realise."

**The only exceptions:**
- Client-requested changes (priced and agreed before proceeding)
- Genuinely unforeseeable issues (e.g., hidden asbestos, structural problems)

Any variation is documented, priced, and approved by you before we proceed.

---

### What deposit do you require?

- **30%** on contract signing
- Staged payments throughout the project
- **5%** retention held for 30 days after completion

This structure protects both parties. You never pay significantly ahead of work completed.

---

### Do you offer finance?

We don't offer finance directly, but many clients use:
- **Remortgaging** — Often the cheapest option
- **Home improvement loans** — Available from most banks
- **Bridging finance** — For renovation projects before refinancing

We provide detailed quotes suitable for lender applications and can speak to mortgage brokers if helpful.

### Why are London renovations so expensive?

Several factors drive costs in NW London:

1. **Labour costs** — Skilled tradespeople command premium rates in London
2. **Access constraints** — Terraced houses, limited parking, narrow streets
3. **Conservation requirements** — Higher-spec materials and craftsmanship
4. **Property values** — Finishes expected to match £2-5m+ homes
5. **Regulations** — Stringent building control and planning

**Our value proposition:** We're not the cheapest, but we deliver quality that matches your property's value. Cutting corners on a Hampstead home is a false economy.

### Will I need to move out during the work?

**Extensions and loft conversions:** Usually not necessary. We phase the work carefully to maintain one habitable area. Most families stay throughout.

**Full renovations:** Depends on scope. If we're rewiring, replumbing, and reconfiguring throughout, moving out for 4-8 weeks makes sense. It's safer, less stressful, and actually speeds up the work.

**We can advise** based on your specific project and family situation.

---

### How do you handle neighbours?

This matters in NW London where houses are close together:

1. **Introduction letters** before work starts
2. **Contact details** provided for any concerns
3. **Clean, tidy sites** — no materials blocking pavements
4. **Noise hours strictly observed** (8am-6pm Mon-Fri, 9am-1pm Sat)
5. **Party wall process** handled professionally
6. **Regular check-ins** during noisy phases

We've never had a neighbour complaint escalate. Good neighbour relations are part of our service.

## Timelines

### How far in advance do I need to book?

| Project Type | Lead Time |
|--------------|-----------|
| Maintenance/small works | 1-2 weeks |
| Bathroom | 4-6 weeks |
| Kitchen extension | 6-10 weeks |
| Loft conversion | 6-10 weeks |
| Full renovation | 2-3 months |

**Planning adds:** 8-12 weeks before we can start

**Tip:** Contact us early in your planning process. It doesn't commit you to anything and helps with realistic scheduling.

---

### What if there are delays?

**Delays we cause:** We don't charge extra. If we underestimate, that's our problem.

**Delays outside our control:**
- Planning: We build this into the schedule
- Weather: Significant impact on external work (rare in London)
- Supply chain: We order materials early to minimise risk
- Discoveries: Hidden issues sometimes add time

**Our commitment:** Proactive communication. You'll never be wondering what's happening. If something affects the timeline, you'll know immediately with a revised schedule.

### Do you do small jobs?

Yes, but with minimum charges:
- Half-day minimum: £225 + VAT + materials
- Day rate: £450 + VAT + materials

For maintenance work under £2,000, we're honest — there might be more cost-effective local handymen. We're best suited to projects where quality and project management matter.
